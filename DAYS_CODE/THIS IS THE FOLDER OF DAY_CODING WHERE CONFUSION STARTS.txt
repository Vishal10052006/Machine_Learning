📁 DAY_CODING Folder

This is the DAY_CODING folder — the place where real learning happens.

Sometimes this is where confusion begins.
Sometimes this is where we get stuck.
And sometimes, progress feels slow.

But this is also where growth starts.

This folder contains daily practice code, experiments, and problem-solving attempts.
Not everything here is perfect — but everything here is part of the journey.

If you are exploring this project, you are in the right place.
